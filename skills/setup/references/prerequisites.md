# Prerequisites

What a repository needs before the workflow can run.

## Git

- A remote repository with a local clone.
- A declared integration target branch — the branch bundles commit to, bundle branches are cut
  from, and a bundle lands on.
- If the default branch is protected (required reviews, no direct push, required linear history),
  declare a separate integration target (e.g. `dev`). Promoting it to the protected branch is a
  separate release process this workflow doesn't own or verify.

## Forge

- An authenticated CLI for the host holding the pull requests (`gh` for GitHub). Ticket and bundle
  status are derived from pull request records, so status queries, the dependency gate, and the Land
  gate all need it. A query that cannot reach the forge reports `unknown`, never `todo`.
