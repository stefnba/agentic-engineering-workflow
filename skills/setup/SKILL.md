# setup

Installs the workflow into a consuming repo. Explore, present, confirm, then write — nothing is
written before the human says yes.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/workflow/git-mechanics.md` before presenting — it holds what the
settings mean.

## What a run writes

| Path                                            | From                                               | Contents                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/config.conf`        | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/config.conf`        | the settings the scripts read                         |
| `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/docs/conventions/git.md` | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/git-conventions.md` | commit and PR conventions a human follows             |
| `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/backlog.md`         | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/backlog.md`         | the empty backlog                                     |
| `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/bundles/.gitkeep`   | created empty                                      | keeps `work/bundles/` tracked before the first bundle |
| `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/GLOSSARY.md`             | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/glossary.md`        | the empty root glossary                               |
| `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/AGENTS.md`               | `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/agents-pointer.md`  | one pointer block naming the workflow                 |
| `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.gitignore`              | appended                                           | the `WORKTREE_DIR` value, so worktrees stay untracked |

Three rules the writes must honour:

- **`${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/config.conf` is committed, not ignored.** A clone without it falls
  back to the defaults in the template — which silently lands work on `main` when the integration
  target is `dev`.
- **The `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.gitignore` entry has to match `WORKTREE_DIR`.** They are one decision
  written twice; a non-default `WORKTREE_DIR` with the default ignore line leaves worktrees staged
  for commit.
- **`${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/backlog.md` and `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/GLOSSARY.md` are created
  empty, and an existing one is never touched.** They are the two artifacts that outlive every
  bundle, and each has a caretaker skill — `backlog` and `glossary` — that writes to it as work
  turns something up, rather than a human sitting down to start one. Seeding both here means
  neither caretaker has to invent a file's header mid-task. Empty is the expected steady state; a
  repo that never earns a glossary entry keeps a file with no entries, and nothing nags about it.

## Process

Every step reports the same way: a bold heading, then one bullet per item —
`` `name` — value, then the reason ``. Never a table; the human reads these blocks in sequence, and a
shape change reads as a different kind of information. The examples below are the format.

### 1. Check prerequisites

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/prerequisites.md` and check each
one: `git remote -v`, the candidate integration target branch exists, `gh auth status` succeeds.

Report all three lines in this order every run, whatever the outcome — a check the human can't see
is one they'll assume passed. Name the value found, not just the verdict. A check that couldn't run
because an earlier one failed is still `❌`, with the reason it couldn't run.

```markdown
**Prerequisites**

- ✅ Remote — `origin` → `git@github.com:acme/billing.git`
- ✅ Integration target — `main` exists on `origin`
- ✅ Forge CLI — `gh` authenticated as `dana-k`

All three pass. Reading what's already in the repo.
```

**Stop and report if any is missing.** A repo without an authenticated forge CLI cannot derive ticket
status at all, so installing the workflow into it produces a system that reports `unknown` for
everything. Say which check failed, why it blocks the workflow, and give copy-pasteable commands that
fix it — in dependency order when more than one failed, since authenticating precedes creating a
repository and creating one precedes pushing to it. Print the commands; never run them.

````markdown
**Prerequisites**

- ❌ Remote — none configured; `git remote -v` is empty
- ❌ Integration target — can't check, no remote to check against
- ✅ Forge CLI — `gh` authenticated as `dana-k`

**Stopped — nothing written.** Ticket and bundle status are derived from pull request records,
so a repo with no remote reports `unknown` for everything the workflow asks.

If the repository doesn't exist on the forge yet, create it and push:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit"
gh repo create <name> --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

If it already exists, wire up the remote instead:

```bash
git remote add origin <url> && git push -u origin <branch>
```

Then re-run `/setup`.
````

### 2. Explore

Read what exists; don't assume. Report under a **Repository** heading, one bullet per item in the
order below, each naming what was found — `absent` is the normal case for a first run, not a failure:

- `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/config.conf` — present means this is a re-run; read its current values
  so the settings question offers them rather than the template defaults.
- `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/AGENTS.md` and `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/CLAUDE.md` — which the repo uses, and
  whether either already carries a pointer block from a prior run.
- `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/docs/conventions/git.md` — present means the repo already owns its
  conventions; never overwrite one without asking.
- `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/backlog.md` and `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/GLOSSARY.md` — present means
  the repo already keeps one; report how many items or entries it holds, and leave it alone.
- `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/bundles/` — present means a prior run or bundle work already created
  it; leave it alone.
- `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.gitignore` — whether a worktree line is already there.
- The repository's default branch, as the natural `INTEGRATION_TARGET` candidate.
- **Whether this is a monorepo**, which decides how many `AGENTS.md` and `GLOSSARY.md` files the repo ends up with — see the **Monorepos** section of
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/workflow/artifacts.md`. Stop at the first of these that hits:
  1. A workspace declaration — `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `workspaces` in the root `package.json`,
     `[workspace]` in `Cargo.toml`, `[tool.uv.workspace]` or `[tool.poetry.group]` in
     `pyproject.toml`, `go.work`.
  2. A monorepo build orchestrator at the root — `turbo.json`, `nx.json`, `lerna.json`, `rush.json`,
     `moon.yml`.
  3. More than one package manifest below the root, by glob: `*/package.json`, `*/*/package.json`,
     and the same shape for `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `build.gradle*`, `pom.xml`.

  Name the packages found and the signal that found them, or say single-package and name what you
  checked. A vendored dependency or an examples folder trips rule 3, so this is a reading rather
  than a fact — which is why it goes in the report the human confirms, and is never asked as a
  setting.

```markdown
**Repository**

- `work/config.conf` — absent; first run, so the settings below start from the template defaults
- `AGENTS.md` — absent, and no `CLAUDE.md` either; the pointer block needs a new `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/conventions/git.md` — absent
- `work/backlog.md` — absent
- `GLOSSARY.md` — found, 6 entries; it stays as it is
- `.gitignore` — found, no worktree line
- Default branch — `main`
- Layout — monorepo; `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declares `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/ui`
```

### 3. Ask the three settings

Ask all three in one round, each with its recommended answer. The template documents what each
controls; don't restate its wording.

- **`INTEGRATION_TARGET`** — the branch bundles land on and bundle branches are cut from. Recommend
  the default branch, and **ask whether it's protected** — required reviews, no direct push, or
  required linear history make it unusable as an integration target, and the repo needs a separate
  branch such as `dev` instead. Protection isn't readable with this skill's tools: it's their answer
  to give, never a check to run.
- **`TICKET_MERGE_METHOD`** — `squash | merge`, for ticket PRs only.
- **`WORKTREE_DIR`** — where ticket worktrees go.

Branch names and how a finished bundle lands are **not** questions. The workflow fixes both.

### 4. Confirm

**Confirm the decisions, not the file bodies.** The three answered values and which existing files
get touched are what the human is being asked to approve; a pasted template is text they can read in
the plugin any time, and it buries the values inside its own commented defaults.

Report four parts in order, then wait for a yes:

1. **Settings** — the three answered values, one bullet each, with the reason it was chosen. On a
   re-run, name the current value each one replaces.
2. **Writes** — one bullet per path, each with its action: create from template, append the block
   below, or skip with the reason (an existing `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/docs/conventions/git.md` is
   theirs and stays). In a monorepo say **root** on every one of them and say it once more in a
   closing line: a human who just read a list of four packages will otherwise assume some of this
   lands per package.
3. **The appended block, verbatim** — only for files the repo already owns, which is where a wrong
   line actually costs something. Show the lines instead of counting them.
4. **`Proceed?`**

````markdown
**Settings**

- `INTEGRATION_TARGET` — `dev`; you reported `main` protected by required reviews
- `TICKET_MERGE_METHOD` — `squash` (default)
- `WORKTREE_DIR` — `.claude/worktrees` (default)

**Writes**

- `work/config.conf` — create from template, carrying the values above
- `docs/conventions/git.md` — create from template
- `work/backlog.md` — create empty from template
- `work/bundles/` — create with an empty `.gitkeep`
- `GLOSSARY.md` — skip; 6 entries already, and it's yours
- `AGENTS.md` — create; repo uses neither AGENTS.md nor CLAUDE.md today
- `.gitignore` — append the block below

Appended to `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Agentic workflow worktrees
.claude/worktrees/
```

Proceed?
````

### 5. Write

1. Copy the config template to `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/config.conf`, substituting the three
   answered values. Keep its comments — they are what a later reader consults.
2. Copy the git-conventions template to `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/docs/conventions/git.md`. Skip
   entirely when one already exists; never overwrite it.
3. Copy the backlog template to `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/backlog.md` and the glossary template
   to `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/GLOSSARY.md`, dropping each one's leading template comment. Keep the
   glossary template's remaining commented guidance — it is the entry form the first writer fills
   in, and its own text says to delete each comment as that happens. Skip either file entirely when
   one of that name already exists; never merge into one or overwrite it. In a monorepo write only
   the root `GLOSSARY.md`: the `glossary` skill creates a domain one when a term earns it, and a
   root glossary's Domains section only exists once those do.
4. Create `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/bundles/` with an empty `.gitkeep` — git can't track an
   empty directory, and the status scripts treat a missing `work/bundles/` as an error rather than
   "no bundles yet". Skip when the directory already exists.
5. Append the pointer block to `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/AGENTS.md`, or to
   `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/CLAUDE.md` when that's what the repo uses — never both. Replace a block
   from a prior run rather than appending a duplicate. In a monorepo it goes in the root file only:
   a package `AGENTS.md` adds what is specific to that package, and a second pointer block there
   would be the duplicate the root already covers.
6. Append the `WORKTREE_DIR` value to `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.gitignore` if no matching line is
   there.

### 6. Report

Report an **Installed** bullet per path — written, appended, or skipped with its reason — then the
two things the human owns from here. **Commit
`${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/config.conf`**, and `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/docs/conventions/git.md` is
now theirs to edit — a re-run won't overwrite it.

```markdown
**Installed**

- `work/config.conf` — written: `INTEGRATION_TARGET=dev`, `TICKET_MERGE_METHOD=squash`,
  `WORKTREE_DIR=.claude/worktrees`
- `docs/conventions/git.md` — skipped; already present, left untouched
- `work/backlog.md` — created, empty
- `work/bundles/` — created, with `.gitkeep`
- `GLOSSARY.md` — skipped; 6 entries already, left untouched
- `AGENTS.md` — created, carrying the pointer block
- `.gitignore` — appended `.claude/worktrees/`

Two things are yours from here:

- **Commit `work/config.conf`.** A clone without it falls back to the template defaults silently —
  which lands work on `main` instead of `dev`.
- `docs/conventions/git.md` is yours to edit. A re-run of `/setup` won't overwrite it.
```
