# Land one bundle

**You are the closer.** Every ticket in this bundle already passed the human's Accept gate, so there
is no fourth approval here. What remains is: move what the durable docs still need out of the bundle,
delete it, land it, leave the integration target green.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/workflow/lifecycle.md` (Land) and
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/workflow/git-mechanics.md` before starting — this skill doesn't restate
their steps and rules, it sequences them and says which script runs where.

You run **inline, in the human's session**, from the repository root. Surface anything surprising the
moment you hit it, not in a report at the end.

## Boundaries

- **Land's own commits carry no behavior change.** Documentation, backlog, and bundle files only. A
  change that would alter behavior is not Land work: stop and hand it back to the Plan gate as a new
  bundle, however small it looks.
- **A merge conflict is the human's**, with one exception the script already handles: a conflict in
  `work/backlog.md` is resolved by keeping both sides, which `land-bundle.sh` does itself. Anything
  else leaves the conflict in place and exits `7`. Surface it with the path and stop — a land is
  exactly where a guessed resolution is most expensive.
- **Never rebase, never squash, never force.** The ticket commits are the only bridge left from a
  landed line of code back to the ticket that approved it once the bundle is gone.
- **Deletion is the default; absorption is the exception that must justify itself.** Most of a spec
  routes nowhere — reconcile already absorbed it, or it was dead on delivery.

## Process

### 1. Resolve the bundle and open the land

Resolve `$ARGUMENTS` against `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/bundles/`. No match, or two matching — ask,
don't guess.

Then run, from the repository root:

```text
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/land-bundle.sh start <bundle-id>
```

It gates the whole stage: every ticket `done` from its PR record, no stale land worktree, then a
detached worktree on the integration target with the bundle branch merged in. **Every step below
happens in the worktree it prints** — that tree is where the checks run and what gets published.

Read a non-zero exit as a stop, not as something to work around: its message states the reason and
the next action — report it, and leave anything it says is in the way to the human.

### 2. Absorb what the durable docs still need

Walk the spec section by section. The bundle dies two steps from here and no durable doc may reference a
bundle, so anything worth keeping moves **now** or is lost:

- target state no colocated `README.md` yet states → that README
- a decision that would be expensive to relitigate → the `record-decision` skill
- a term this work coined, renamed, or disambiguated → the `glossary` skill

Per-ticket reconcile should have caught most of this; this pass catches what only became true once
every ticket had landed.

**Done when** grepping the bundle ID across the repository outside `work/` returns nothing.

### 3. Reconcile the backlog

Unfinished scope, deferred ideas, and anything you noticed while landing → the `backlog` skill, one
line each. New work starts as a backlog line, never as commits here.

**Sweep the Reviewer's candidates.** List this bundle's merged ticket PRs
(`gh pr list --base <bundle-branch> --state merged`) and read each round comment's Backlog
candidates section. Drop what a later round fixed, a sibling ticket landed, or the previous step
absorbed; merge duplicates across PRs. Offer the survivors through the same `backlog` skill batch —
it owns the bar, and most candidates should not survive it. A forge failure here is reported in the
hand-back, never a reason to stop the land.

**Then retire what this bundle made true**, through that skill's prune scoped to this bundle: lines
whose work now exists, and lines the previous step absorbed into a durable doc. The picked line is
already gone — `shape-bundle` deleted it when it published — so what's left here is every _other_ line this
work overtook.

### 4. Delete the bundle

`git rm -r` the bundle directory. Git history is the archive — no `done/`, no tombstone, no copy
under another name.

Commit steps 2–4 following `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/docs/conventions/git.md`.

### 5. Re-verify, then land

Run the repository's canonical checks **in the land worktree** — full suite, lint, typecheck,
whatever CI runs. This state carries your commits and the bundle merge, so no CI run has seen it.
Red means stop and report; nothing is pushed yet, so abandoning costs a directory.

Green, then:

```text
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/land-bundle.sh push <bundle-id>
```

**Exit `6` is not a failure — it is the loop.** The integration target moved while you were working,
so `push` merged it in and stopped. Go back to the top of this step, re-run the canonical checks
against the new state, and run `push` again. Repeat until it exits `0`. Never push past a `6`: the
merged state is one no check has run against, which is the whole reason the script refuses to
publish it for you.

**Red after a `6` is an escalation, not a fix loop.** The break lives in a merged state no reviewer
saw, so it is not yours to patch — a fix would be a behavior change, which Boundaries already rules
out of Land. Report the failing check's output and the upstream commits the merge brought in, then
stop; the human routes it, usually as a new bundle.

### 6. Remove the leftovers

```text
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/land-bundle.sh cleanup <bundle-id>
```

Ticket branches, the bundle branch, every worktree — Land's own last, and from the repository root.
Branches a forge already deleted on merge are skipped, not treated as an error. Cleanup guards
itself: it refuses outright when the bundle branch carries unlanded work, and it keeps any ticket
branch whose PR is not merged — a live claim — reporting what it kept.

### 7. Hand back

**Query the end state before reporting it.** `cleanup` exiting `0` proves it ran, not that nothing
survived it — a branch the forge already removed and a branch it refused to remove both leave that
exit code, and a ticket branch it kept keeps its worktree too. `cleanup` removes the scaffolding
directories it emptied, `$WORKTREE_DIR` itself included, so a missing directory is the clean
outcome. Run these from the repository root and report what they return, not what you expected:

```text
. ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/_config.sh   # for $WORKTREE_DIR
git fetch --prune origin && git ls-remote --heads origin       # ticket and bundle branches
git worktree list                                              # every registered worktree
[ -d "$WORKTREE_DIR" ] && find "$WORKTREE_DIR" -mindepth 1     # survivors; a missing dir is clean
ls work/bundles/                                               # the bundle itself
```

Then fill every slot — an empty one says `none`, because a missing line reads as forgotten:

```text
Landed     <bundle-id> on <target> at <sha>
Absorbed   <what moved, into which doc>
Backlog    +<lines added>  −<lines retired>
Removed    branches ✅  worktrees ✅  bundle ✅
Surfaced   <what you hit and handed back rather than resolved>
```

A ✅ is the query's answer, so it is yours to withhold: replace any that is not clean with what is
still there and why, and route it through the `backlog` skill when it is a gap rather than a one-off.
