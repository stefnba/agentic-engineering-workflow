# Pick the next candidate

You set the table; the human chooses. Priority is the human's judgment — never hand yourself the
pick, and never nudge it through ordering, emphasis, or a recommendation nobody asked for.

## 1. Lay out the field

**Read `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/work/backlog.md` in full.** Missing or empty: say so and stop. There
is nothing to pick, and intent the human brings directly skips the backlog for `/interview-me` or
`/shape-bundle` anyway.

**Check what's already in flight** with
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/bundle-status.sh`, run from the repository root. It
renders as the first line of the block below, stated as fact: starting something new competes with
finishing those, but whether that matters is the human's call.

## 2. Present candidates

**Render the field as one block in this shape**, nothing before or after it:

```markdown
**In flight**: 2026-08-11-billing-retries (active) · 2026-08-12-export-csv (shaped)

**Candidates** — file order, not priority:

| #   | Kind      | Areas      | Problem                                                      |
| --- | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | follow-up | server     | no transaction support — repository ops can't run atomically |
| 2   | drift     | api client | list endpoints each hand-split searchParams                  |

_+3 lines withheld by the `ui` filter_

Pick a number, or ask about any line.
```

- **Problem text verbatim** — the human recognizes their own lines. Only the leading kind and area
  tags move into their own columns; never paraphrase, shorten, or merge. A line carrying evidence
  sub-bullets shows its first line only, and the human asks about the row to see the rest.
- **`#` is a conversation handle**, counted top to bottom over the displayed rows so the human can
  pick by number. It carries no rank. File order is deliberate: ranking happens here, in front of the
  human, not in the file and never by you.
- **Every row looks the same** — no icons, bolding, or flags on individual rows. Visual emphasis is
  a nudge toward that row.
- **The footer counts what `$ARGUMENTS` filtered out**, so narrowing never hides lines silently. All
  rows shown: drop the footer.

**Answer questions from the repository, not from opinion.** "Is this still real?" and "how big is
this?" you settle with Read and Grep, citing the file. Give a recommendation only when the human
explicitly asks for one, and label it as yours.

## 3. Route the pick

Wait for the human to name a line or a number, then judge one thing — is it crisp enough to shape
from? — and hand off in this shape:

```markdown
Picked: `[follow-up] [server] no transaction support — repository ops can't run atomically`

Crisp — problem and rough scope would support a spec. Next: `/shape-bundle` here, no argument needed; the
line above is its input.
```

The verbatim quote is load-bearing: `/shape-bundle` and `/interview-me` read their input from this
conversation, and this block is what they receive.

Three exits, differing only in that second sentence:

- **Crisp** — `/shape-bundle`, as above.
- **Vague** — name what is still unsettled and point at `/interview-me` with the line as its
  argument.
- **Feasibility or diagnosis genuinely unknown** — point at `/shape-bundle` anyway, saying that what it
  shapes is an investigation or spike rather than the implementation.

**A pick that isn't on the list is direct intent.** The human naming new work mid-dialogue skips the
backlog by design; route it through the same verdict. No line exists, so `shape-bundle` has nothing to
delete later.

**Leave the invocation to the human.** `/shape-bundle` and `/interview-me` are manual-only because invoking
one is the act of approval that closes this gate.

**Leave the picked line in the backlog.** `shape-bundle` deletes it in the commit that publishes the
bundle.
