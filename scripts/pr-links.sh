# Pin to the commit that last published this bundle on the integration target — the approved state.

# reconcile amendments no human approved, and it is deleted at Land, so nothing on it is reachable
# afterwards. A bundle is committed straight to the integration target, so this commit outlives
# every branch. A repeated Plan gate republishes there too, which is why `-1` is the approved
# version and not the original one.
